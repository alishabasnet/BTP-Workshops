In this workshop, I learned about creating new classes that are connected to each other, where
one class can inherit features from another class. This concept is called inheritance, and it
allows us to reuse code and extend functionality. Specifically, we explored derived classes,
which are classes that inherit properties and behaviors from a base class. In our case,
we created a derived class called Book, which inherited from a base class named LibraryItem.

e.g: First, we made a class called LibraryItem to represent items in a library, like books.
Then, we created another class called Book that was based on LibraryItem but had extra features,
like the author's name.

Another thing I learned was how to fix warnings that could cause problems in the code.
For example, I learned to include a special kind of function called a "virtual destructor"
to ensure that objects are deleted correctly without causing issues.

Apart of that, I gained more insights into implementing the rule of three (copy constructor,
copy assignment operator, and destructor) to ensure proper memory management, especially when
dealing with dynamically allocated resources.
