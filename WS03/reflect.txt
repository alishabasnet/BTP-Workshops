This workshop teaches about classes and objects. Unlike previous workshop,
where we defined `struct` to structure our datatype, this workshop lightened
about the classes and objects and how data members and methods can be grouped
together to create a separate isolated object. Along with this, I was able to
learn and work with standard formattings on c++ like setting width, precision
and fill too. Similar to previous tasks, this also included dynamic memory all-
ocation and freeing memory. But one different thing was in class, we could use its
destructor function `~ClassName()` to free memory related to the object of that class,
which gives better way to de-allocate it.
On checking with valgrind, I was getting memory leakage ( 62 bytes ), and tried so hard
to fix it. At last i got to know about the destructor function from internet, and i was able
to solve my problem. The link to the reference is also listed below:
